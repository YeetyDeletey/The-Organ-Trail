Currently still heavily in progress. While the goal is to create an expanded version of The Organ Trail, this project is still currently in early development and is building up to the base features of The Organ Trail.

A project focused on using the structure of the classic game The Organ Trail as a baseline for an improved, modernized version featuring a zombie apocalypse. There are 2 main focuses:
1. The base features of The Organ Trail
2. Adding plenty of features from the zombie apocalypse, primarily focused on making the game require more player interaction. For example, the hunting minigame will be expanded to feature zombies that act as threats, requiring more player interaction and skill to get something good from. On top of that, the trail will require more interaction with the people and objects on it, giving the various forts more purpose than trailmarkers.

The repository is marked public, but so far this is planned as a solo project. If you want to join in and work on it, contact me.
